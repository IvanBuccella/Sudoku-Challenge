Design and develop a Sudoku challenge game on a P2P network. Each user can place a number of the sudoku game; if it is not already placed takes 1 point, if it is already placed and it is rights take 0 points, in other case receive -1 point. The games are based on a 9 x 9 matrix. All users that play to a game are automatically informed when a user increment its score and when the game is finished. The system allows the users to generate (automatically) a new Sudoku challenge identified by a name, join in a challenge using a nickname, get the integer matrix describing the Sudoku challenge, and place a solution number. As described in the [SudokuGame Java API](https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/distributedsystems-unisa/blob/master/homework/SudokuGame.java).
